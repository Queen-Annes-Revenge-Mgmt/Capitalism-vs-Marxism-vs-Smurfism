# CONCEPT: Capitalism vs Marxism vs Smurfism
---

## Thesis to Challenge: 

Social class is fundamentally determined by one's relationship to the means of production, not by individual wealth.

## Counter-Argument: 

Neither system truly resolves poverty due to persistent personal gain motives at lower levels. 

<br />

## Refutation:

Even under Marxism, the poor must still rely on others to act in good faith. But the system leaves room for individuals to justify self-serving actions — allowing personal gain to be used as a rationalization for acting in bad faith.

<br />

## Rebuttal:

Smurfism aligns better with our democratic system than either Marxism or Capitalism.

### Is it Realistic to think Marxism could ever take over in America:


    Given the current United states trump republican administration, ICE, and a looming class war on
    the horizon, how likely would it be for Marxism to replace united states current system and gain 
    mainstream traction? Please use all updated resources and provide percentage values within 
    your conclusions.

### Assume Marxism took over in the united states, do slumlords still exist

    Let's assume Marxism took over in the united states everywhere. In this example, do 
    slumlords still exist? Or has this new system removed the greed factor Capitalism 
    creates through self gain? Is there any chance for bad actors within the city housing 
    inspectors to make decisions solely for personal gain, say payments from a landlord to 
    look the other way? Does greed as a human emotion doesn't disappear because the 
    system changed?

# Conclusions:
---

<br />

>
> We're fucked either way, as class and wealth remain linked. 
>
<br />

    Neither system offers a viable path forward, as the odds of successfully 
    implementing them are too low. Worse still, the underlying issues between 
    class and wealth remain—they're just redefined. Class becomes tied to 
    perceived wealth at any given moment, making it just as influential 
    and exclusionary as before.

    A few key truths:

    - No system guarantees success just by being implemented. Culture, 
    power, and enforcement shape the outcome.

    - Class and wealth remain linked, often through perception (status, 
    assets, influence), not just income.

    - Inequality can resurface even in systems designed to eliminate 
    it, if power structures adapt.
